mascon2loading: A MATLAB-based tool for calculating 3-D deformation due to surface mass loading

MATLAB Code for calculating Earth surface's 3-D loading displacement due to surface mass changes in idealized spherical reference frame;

Note: Input Load mass field ['meter' in the unit of EWH] must be global mass grids, such as GRACE MASCON solutions

This code was also used for the loading calculation in several of our previous works. e.g.,
